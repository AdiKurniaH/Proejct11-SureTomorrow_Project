# Sure Tomorrow Project
An insurance company called "Sure Tomorrow" wants to solve several problems with the help of machine learning. You are also asked to evaluate this possibility.

- Task 1: Find clients that are similar to certain client criteria. This task will make it easier for the company to carry out marketing.
- Task 2: Predict whether a new client is likely to take out an insurance claim. Are model predictions better than dummy model predictions?
- Task 3: Predict the size of an insurance claim a new client is likely to receive using a linear regression model.
- Task 4: Protect the client's personal data without breaking the model of the previous task.
It is important to develop data transformation algorithms that can prevent misuse of clients' personal information if the data falls into the wrong hands. This is referred to as data hiding or data obfuscation. However, data protection procedures also need to be considered so that the quality of the machine learning model does not decrease.
